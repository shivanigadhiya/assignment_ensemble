    "Q1: What is Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor is an ensemble learning method used for regression tasks that builds multiple decision trees and merges their outputs to improve predictive accuracy and control overfitting.\n",
    "Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "It operates by creating a \"forest\" of decision trees, where each tree is trained on a random subset of the data and features.\n",
    "Q2: How Does Random Forest Regressor Reduce the Risk of Overfitting?\n",
    "\n",
    "Overfitting in Decision Trees:\n",
    "\n",
    "Individual decision trees can easily overfit the training data by capturing noise and complex patterns.\n",
    "Random Forest Mechanism:\n",
    "\n",
    "Averaging Predictions: By averaging the predictions of multiple trees, Random Forest reduces the variance associated with individual trees.\n",
    "Bootstrap Sampling: Each tree is trained on a different random sample of the data (with replacement), which introduces diversity among the trees.\n",
    "Feature Randomness: Randomly selecting a subset of features for each split in the trees further reduces correlation among the trees, leading to a more generalized model.\n",
    "Q3: How Does Random Forest Regressor Aggregate the Predictions of Multiple Decision Trees?\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation Method:\n",
    "The Random Forest Regressor aggregates the predictions of multiple decision trees by taking the average of their outputs.\n",
    "Formula:\n",
    "If ( T ) is the number of trees and ( \\hat{y}i ) is the prediction from the ( i^{th} ) tree, the final prediction ( \\hat{y} ) is given by: [ \\hat{y} = \\frac{1}{T} \\sum{i=1}^{T} \\hat{y}_i ]\n",
    "Q4: What Are the Hyperparameters of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Common Hyperparameters:\n",
    "n_estimators: The number of trees in the forest.\n",
    "max_depth: The maximum depth of each tree.\n",
    "min_samples_split: The minimum number of samples required to split an internal node.\n",
    "min_samples_leaf: The minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node.\n",
    "max_features: The number of features to consider when looking for the best split.\n",
    "bootstrap: Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees.\n",
    "Q5: What Is the Difference Between Random Forest Regressor and Decision Tree Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Model Complexity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision Tree Regressor: A single tree that can easily overfit the data.\n",
    "Random Forest Regressor: An ensemble of multiple trees that reduces overfitting through averaging.\n",
    "Performance:\n",
    "\n",
    "Random Forest generally provides better accuracy and robustness compared to a single decision tree.\n",
    "Interpretability:\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision trees are easier to interpret, while Random Forests are more complex and less interpretable due to the aggregation of multiple trees.\n",
    "Q6: What Are the Advantages and Disadvantages of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "High Accuracy: Generally provides high predictive accuracy.\n",
    "Robustness: Less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees.\n",
    "Handles Missing Values: Can handle missing data and maintain accuracy.\n",
    "Feature Importance: Provides insights into feature importance.\n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Complexity: More complex and less interpretable than single decision trees.\n",
    "Computationally Intensive: Requires more computational resources and time for training.\n",
    "Memory Usage: Can consume more memory due to multiple trees.\n",
    "Q7: What Is the Output of Random Forest Regressor?\n",
    "\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "The output of the Random Forest Regressor is a continuous value, which is the average of the predictions made by all the individual decision trees in the forest.\n",
    "Q8: Can Random Forest Regressor Be Used for Classification Tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes:\n",
    "While the Random Forest Regressor is specifically designed for regression tasks, the Random Forest algorithm can also be adapted for classification tasks using the Random Forest Classifier.\n",
    "In classification, the output is determined by majority voting among the trees rather than averaging."
